##CREATES VIRTUAL ART GALLERY

In this project, you'll be able to attend a virtual art gallery. 


##HOW IT WORKS: 
Once you're on the first page, click "begin tour". The button has an event that will enable you to view art pieces one by one. This is a virtual gallery. Here you can view images of the most famous art pieces. Along with the images, there are short descriptions of the art piece as well as the name of the painting and the author. It also includes a Wikipedia link where you can find more information about the art piece. The description of the artwork has a mouseover event that allows text to change colors.
Below the description is a comments section. There you can leave a comment about the art piece along with your name. If the comment is provided without a name, the name will appear as  "anonymous". The filter feature is implemented in the comment section. You'll be able to view only the last 5 comments of the artwork.  
Art pieces are located in order. You can access different art pieces by clicking "Previous gallery item" or "Next gallery item". You can return to the 1st page by clicking the "Exit gallery" button.


##MATERIALS USED 
Pictures and information about art pieces are used from the public domain.
