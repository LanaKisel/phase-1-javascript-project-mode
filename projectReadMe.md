##CREATES VIRTUAL ART GALLERY

In this project you'll be able to attend a virtual art gallery. 


##HOW IT WORKS: 
Once you're one the first page, click "begin tour", the button has an event that will enable you to view art pieces one by one. This is virtual gallery. Here you can view images of the most famous art pieces. Along with the images there are a short description about the art piece as well as the name of the painting and the author. It also includes a wikipedia link where you can find more information about the art piece. Description of the art work has a mouseover event taht alows text to changes colors.
Below the decription is a comments section. There you can leave a comment about the art piece along with your name. If the comment is provided without a name, name will become "anonymous". Filter feature is implemented on the comment section. You'll be able to view only las 5 comments of an art work.  
Art pieces are located in order. You can access different art pieces by clicking "Previuos gallery item" or "Next gallery item". You can return on the 1st page by clicking "Exit gallery" button when on 1st or last piece of art work.
